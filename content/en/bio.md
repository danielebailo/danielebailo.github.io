Driven by strong technical creativity and the ability to envision innovative solutions, **Daniele Bailo** has been working for many years at the intersection of **Research Data Management** and **Artificial Intelligence**, developing original approaches for data integration, management, and valorisation in the Earth Sciences.

He is **IT Officer of EPOS-ERIC**, with strategic responsibilities for the evolution of the European digital infrastructure dedicated to integrated access to multidisciplinary data, services, and software.

At INGV, he also serves as **Head of the Functional Unit “Computational Geophysics – Information Systems – EPOS”**, coordinating institutional and project-related activities in the fields of information systems, digital infrastructures, and AI technologies for geosciences.

He is also **coordinator of AI-focused projects and working groups at INGV**, with particular emphasis on deep learning for seismology, generative models, and LLM/RAG-based applications for building intelligent agents in the geosciences.

He is **Scientific Coordinator of European projects** within the *ENVRI, EOSC, and Virtual Research Environments (VREs)* ecosystems and holds roles as **Work Package Leader** and **Task Leader** in several Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020 consortia. He has led international technical teams and contributed to the definition of architectural models, semantic standards, metadata frameworks, and FAIR processes for the Solid Earth Science community.

His scientific activity includes **numerous contributions to international peer-reviewed journals**, as well as technical reports, conference proceedings, and invited talks at European conferences, with a growing focus on the application of artificial intelligence in Earth Sciences and on the ethical dimensions of AI.
