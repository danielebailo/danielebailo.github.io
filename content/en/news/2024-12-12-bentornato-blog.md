I opened this section to gather quick updates on what I am doing as INGV technologist and EPOS-ERIC IT Officer:

- operational notes on European and national projects
- links to talks or forthcoming publications
- short technical diaries on tools, datasets and integrations

This way I can keep the site light and up to date without going through WordPress.
